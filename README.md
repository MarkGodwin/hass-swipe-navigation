## Config:
**If you just want to use the default config values you don't need to add a config at all.**

If you want to modify the configuration, place it in the root of your dashboard configuration.

**Config Options:**

| Name            | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| swipe_amount    | number  | 15      | Minimum percent of screen needed to be swiped in order to navigate.                                                                                                                   |
| skip_tabs       | string  |         | A comma separated list of views to skip when swiping. e.g., `1,3,5`. _Note that tabs count starts at `0`, so the first is `0`, second is `1`, and so on._                             |
| skip_hidden     | boolean | true    | Automatically skips hidden tabs.                                                                                                                                                      |
| wrap            | boolean | true    | Wrap from first tab to last tab and vice versa.                                                                                                                                       |
| prevent_default | boolean | false   | Prevents the browsers default horizontal swipe actions. May require a browser refresh to take effect, if using an HA companion app this can be done by closing the app and reopening. |
| animate         | string  | none    | Swipe animations. Can be: `none`, `swipe`, `fade`, `flip`. The swipe animation should be considered experimental and depending on your setup may appear buggy.                        |
| logger_level    | string  | warn    | Set logging level. Possible values are: `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.                                                                                                  |


**Example:**

Don't just copy the example, it won't fit your needs. Build your own using the config options above.

```yaml
swipe_nav:
  wrap: false
  animate: swipe
  skip_tabs: 5,6,7,8
  prevent_default: true
  swipe_amount: 30
  
views:
```

If you need help, Mark Watt has an excellent video covering the configuration [in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IPN9lBEfE&t=663s).
